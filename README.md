# kmer.total.R
kmer.total.R is an R script that compares unique kmers from two genomes

##Files
kmer6.total.R takes two input files of relatively similar size and generates a report including number of similar kmers and distance

kmer7.total.R takes two input files: should include reference sequence (may be from complete or draft sequence) and test sequence (used for kmers from raw reads) and reports number of similar kmers compared to reference sequence

##Input files
kmer.total.R takes kAnalyze output files for two genome sequences
